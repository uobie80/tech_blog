      <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic
        typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>

      <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly
        repetitive body text used throughout.</p>
